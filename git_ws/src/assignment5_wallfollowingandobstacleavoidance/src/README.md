# Assignment 5
In this assignment, we demonstrated wall following and obstacle avoidance in Gazebo and on the physical TurtleBot.

## Running the programs
The python scripts for these paths are located in the [scripts](/git_ws/src/assignment5_wallfollowingandobstacleavoidance/src/scripts) directory. The launch files needed for running the codes in Gazebo are located in the [launch](/git_ws/src/assignment5_wallfollowingandobstacleavoidance/src/launch) directory.  The codes were run on the physical bot by simply executing the python scripts via the SSH connection.

## Videos 
Videos of this demonstration can be found in the [video](/git_ws/src/assignment5_wallfollowingandobstacleavoidance/src/videos) directory.  This contains videos of wall following and obstacle avoidance both on the physical bot and in Gazebo.
