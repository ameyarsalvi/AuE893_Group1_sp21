## Assignment 4
In this assignment, we demonstrated the open loop square and circle paths from Assignments 2 and 3 on the physical TurtleBot.

## Running the programs
The python scripts for these paths are located in the [scripts](/scripts) directory. The launch file needed is move.launch, which is located in the 'launch' directory.  This file takes a 'code' argument, which specifies which script to run.  The circle path can be launched with the following command:

Command: `roslaunch assignment4_sim2real move.launch code:=circle`

Similarly, the command to launch the square program is as follows:

Command: `roslaunch assignment3_turtlebot3 move.launch code:=square`

## Videos 
Videos of this demonstration can be found in the 'video' directory.  This contains videos of both the square and circle paths on the robot as well as screen recordings of the command line commands being executed.
